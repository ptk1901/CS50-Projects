Toward the end of World 1-1 in Nintendo’s Super Mario Bros., Mario must ascend right-aligned
pyramid of bricks.
In a file called mario.c in a folder called mario-less, implement a program in C that recreates 
that pyramid, using hashes (#) for bricks, as in the below:

       #
      ##
     ###
    ####
   #####
  ######
 #######
########
But prompt the user for an int for the pyramid’s actual height, so that the program can also 
output shorter pyramids like the below:

  #
 ##
###
Re-prompt the user, again and again as needed, if their input is not greater than 0 or not an int 
altogether.
